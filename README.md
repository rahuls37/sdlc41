## Project Requirements

I need a web application that allows users to upload CSV files, visualize the data as charts, and download reports. The application should have user authentication and the ability to save previous visualizations. It should support at least 3 types of charts (bar, line, pie) and allow users to customize colors and labels.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
